Chef Cookbook - Certificate Management
==============
This Chef cookbook will manage SSL certificates and keys through the use of Chef Vault.

Changes Performed
------------
1. Make sure `/data/ssl` as well as the `certs` and `keys` subdirectories are owned by root:root with 750 permissions
2. Deploy SSL certificates in both Apache and NginX (certificate + ca-bundle in one file) formats to `/data/ssl/certs`
3. Deploy SSL certificate keys to `/data/ssl/keys`
4. Removes any files from `/data/ssl`, `/data/ssl/certs`, and `/data/ssl/keys` that were not placed there by Chef

Requirements
------------
1. Chef (Tested on Chef 13.6.4)
2. Linux chef-clients (Tested on Ubuntu 14.04, Ubuntu 16.04 and CentOS 7.2 but kitchen will let you test anything you want)
3. The chef-vault cookbook from Chef Supermarket
4. The managed_directory cookbook from Chef Supermarket

Installation Tips
